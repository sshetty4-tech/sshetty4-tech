# Hi, I'm Shilpitha 👋  

**Data Analyst & Analytics Engineer**  
MS in Information Systems @ University of Maryland (Robert H. Smith School of Business) – Dec 2025  

I work on **data analysis, analytics engineering, and decision support**: taking raw data, cleaning it, and turning it into something stakeholders can actually use. I care about **clear logic, reproducible workflows, and honest storytelling with data**

## 🧾 Snapshot of What I Actually Do

- **AI Strategy Intern – Pre-Sales Automation @ The Modern Data Company**  
  Building GenAI-powered workflows to support pre-sales: automating customer research, mining call transcripts/notes, and structuring insights using **DataOS**, **YAML pipelines**, and **modern data stacks**.

- **Analytics & Engineering Projects @ UMD**  
  - Designed a **relational database + AI-assisted scheduling logic** for a university course scheduling system (CIC).  
  - Built an **end-to-end finance dashboard** for a manufacturing scenario (FinFactory) with ETL in **Azure/Databricks** and reporting in **Power BI**.  

- **Prior experience with financial / operational data** in audit, consulting, and engineering contexts, focusing on **data quality, controls, and reporting**.

I like problems where **business questions are fuzzy but the data is real**.

## 🧩 How I Approach Data Work

- **Start from the business question**: What decision are we trying to make? What metric will move if we’re successful?  
- **Make data understandable**: Clear joins, explicit assumptions, and documented transformations; notebooks and SQL are written so someone else can read them later.  
- **Prefer simple models that are explainable** over complex ones that are hard to trust.  
- **Ship something usable first**, then iterate: baseline dashboards, then drilldowns; baseline metrics, then advanced features.
